/*
 * 💡 Understanding Programming
 * 
 * What is CODE?
 * Code is like a recipe! Just like a recipe tells you how to make cookies,
 * code tells the computer what to do step by step.
 * 
 * What is a PROGRAM?
 * A program is a collection of instructions that make the computer do something useful.
 * Like a game, a calculator, or even a robot controller!
