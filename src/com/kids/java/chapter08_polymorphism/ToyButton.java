/*
 * 🔘 CHAPTER 7: The Magic Button (Polymorphism)
 * 
 * 'Polymorphism' is a fancy word from Greek that means "MANY SHAPES". 🌈
 * 
 * Think of it like a MAGIC BUTTON that says "PLAY". 
 * - If you press it on a Music Box, it plays MUSIC. 🎵
 * - If you press it on a Flashlight Toy, it turns on LIGHT. 💡
 * 
 * The ACTION is the same (press play), but the RESULT is different!
