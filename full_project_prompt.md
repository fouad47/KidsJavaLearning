# 🚀 Project Generation Prompt: Java Adventure for Kids

If you want to recreate this project from scratch, use the following comprehensive prompt for an AI assistant.

---

## **Role & Persona**
You are a **Senior Java Software Architect and Automation Engineer** with a passion for teaching children. You are extremely patient and your explanations are full of fun analogies (LEGOs, robots, magic boxes). Your goal is to make a child (aged 8-12) fall in love with coding.

## **Objective**
Create a **COMPLETE JAVA PROJECT** that teaches programming from absolute zero to advanced levels, transitioning into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and introducing Test Automation.

## **Project Structure**
- Create a single Java project.
- Every chapter must be in its own package (e.g., `com.kids.java.chapter01_basics`).
- Every chapter must include:
    - Multiple focused Java classes.
    - One `Main.java` class to run and see the output.
    - **Story-based explanations** at the top of each file as comments.
    - Simple, friendly comments throughout the code.

## **The Curriculum (20 Chapters)**

### 🟢 **Level 1: The Basics (The "What" and "How")**
1. **Hello World!**: What is programming? The `main` method.
2. **Magic Boxes**: Variables and Data Types (`int`, `String`, `boolean`).
3. **Decision Paths**: Conditions (`if/else`) and Repetition (`for/while` loops).
4. **Talking to the Computer**: User input using the `Scanner` class.

### 🔵 **Level 2: Building with Blueprints (OOP Concepts)**
5. **Class & Object**: Blueprints vs. real-life objects (using a Car example).
6. **Encapsulation**: Keeping secrets safe with `private` and Getters/Setters.
7. **Inheritance**: Code families (Parents and Children).
8. **Polymorphism**: Same action, different results (Shape-shifters).
9. **Abstraction**: Working with big ideas vs. small details.
10. **Interfaces**: Creating a "Rule Book" for your code.

### 🟣 **Level 3: Power User Features (Advanced Java)**
11. **Static & Final**: Sharing things and making permanent rules.
12. **Fixing Oopsies**: Exception Handling (`try/catch`).
13. **Smart Toy Boxes**: Collections (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`).
14. **Saving Progress**: File Handling (Writing/Reading `.txt` files).
15. **Choosing from a Menu**: Enums (Fixed choices).
16. **Magic Containers**: Generics (Flexible code).
17. **Multi-tasking**: Introduction to Multithreading (Doing two things at once).
18. **Smart Shortcuts**: Lambda Expressions and Streams.

### 🟠 **Level 4: Quality Control (Test Automation)**
19. **Robot Checking Homework**: Introduction to Automation. Manual vs. Automated testing. Simple assertions and "Expected vs. Actual" results.

### 🔴 **Level 5: The Grand Finale**
20. **Mini Project - Robot Pet Game**: A complete, mini-app combining OOP, Collections, Exceptions, and File Handling, with its own Automated Tests.

## **Coding Rules**
- Use clean, simple Java 21+ code.
- No heavy technical jargon.
- Use `System.out.println()` to make the learning visible.
- Ensure every `Main.java` is interactive or displays a clear "Lesson Learned" summary.

## **Final Deliverable**
- Full folder structure.
- Every Java file completely written.
- A `README.md` explaining how to run the adventure.
- A `walkthrough.md` summarizing the journey.
